# One More Day
One More Day is a simplified RTS running on a text-only display. It was inspired by the computers from late 70s and early 80s, but since it's just a prototype, it was made in JavaScript and would not run on those ancient machines.

## Running
Eventually, I intend to publish OMD in two versions: a webpage prototype, where you can play it in your browser, and an actual version optimized for Apple II computers. For now, clone this repo to your computer and launch the index.html file with Live Server in VS Code.
